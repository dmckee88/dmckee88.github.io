        Hi my name is Mr. Fender and I teach computer science at Plymouth High School. I am originally from Texas but my family moved to Colorado when I was in middle school. For high school I went to Culver Military Academy. I taught rocketry and astronomy there over the summer and that is where I met my wife. I graduated from the University of Northern Colorado with a degree in physics. I build rockets and robots and love all thing about science and engeneering.

        The panda is my spirit animal. The panda is the symbol of love, wisdom, strength, determination, kindness, and flexibility. As a totem animal, pands belong to the group that helps to solve problems and as a power animal have the ability to see all sides of a situation. Plus I think awesome becasue they look cool and they have an extra digit on their paws that can act like a thumb which is not something that most animals have.
