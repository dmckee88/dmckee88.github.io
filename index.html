      Hello! My name is Dylan and I am a sophomore at Plymouth High School. I was born in Detroit, Michigan and moved to Indiana about when I was three.
      Growing up I always had a love for soccer and football. From 2nd grade to about 6th grade I played football but I realized I liked watching it rather than playing.
      From kindergarten to sophomore year I've played soccer. I just love soccer above all sports.
      I've had a love for music for a very long time and someday I would like to get serious with music and start a career with it.
