  <h2> Detroit, Michigan</h2>
  <br>
  <hr>
  <br>
  <p> Detroit, Michigan is best known for being "Motor City" with all the vehicles being built there. It is a wonderful city</p> 
  	  that has a bad reputation for violence. Being born there I am not as intimidated by all the crime there like most people.</p>
  	  So with that being said, let's learn a little more about my hometown. </p>
  	
  	  <br>
  	  
  	  <div class="row">
  	  		<div class="columnLeft50">
  	  			<h2> Casinos </h2>
  	  			<p> Detroit is known for having very famous casinos. It was one of the first cities to open up a casino. No </p>
  	  				matter where you go there will always be a casino in a 5 mile radius. And hey you might even win quite a </p>
  	  				bit of money.</p>

  	  			<h2> DownTown Detroit </h2>
  	  			<p> DownTown Detroit is most likely my favorite part of Detroit. There are so many cool shops and you can't </p>
  	  				forget about all the delicious restaurants. You have Greek Town, Mexican Town, and Italian Town. You have </p>
  	  				many options to choose from and they are all delicious.

  	  			<div class="row">
  	  			<h2> Sports </h2>
  	  			<p> Detroit is also famous for their sports teams. We have the Detroit Lions, (which is a very bad team) </p>
  	  				the Detroit Tigers, the Detroit Red Wings, and the Detroit Pistons. All these teams, except the Detroit </p>
  	  				Lions, were a very good team once upon a time. </p>

  	  			<h2> Vehicles </h2>
  	  			<p> I think in my opinion though Detroit is best known for making vehicles. It is the place where Henry Ford </p>
  	  				built the first Ford vehicle. They also put together many motorcycles like Harley Davidsons. And correct </p>
  	  				me if I'm pretty sure they still handmake them. </p>
